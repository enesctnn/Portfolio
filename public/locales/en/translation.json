    "resume": "I graduated from Ankara University Computer Programming in 2022. I'm currently developing Front End Web applications using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Reactjs and Nextjs14 using TypeScript technologies. Every step I took in the software, every new information I learned and needed to learn, made me even more curious, and I look forward to learning new things. As a Front End Web developer, I love researching and reading documentation."
