        "resume": "I graduated from Ankara University Computer Programming in 2022. I am currently developing Front End Web applications using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Reactjs and Nextjs14 using TypeScript technologies. You may visit https://github.com/enesctnn for the websites I developed in these languages. Every step I took in the software, every new information I learned and needed to learn, made me even more curious, and I look forward to learning new things. As a Front End Web developer, I love researching and reading documentation. I also have (beginner-intermediate) level knowledge of Adobe's Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro technologies."
